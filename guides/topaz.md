## Topaz Installation

*Note: modified from https://github.com/tbepler/topaz/blob/master/README.md*

Create and activate a new conda environment with the required dependencies. It is possible to use 
`conda activate topaz` instead of `source activate topaz` for conda versions â‰¥ 4.4.

```shell script
conda create -n topaz python=3.6
source activate topaz
```

With the `topaz` environment active, install the Topaz package with its dependencies.

```shell script
conda install topaz -c tbepler -c pytorch
```

If your machine/computing cluster does not already have a global installation of `cudatoolkit` available, it can be 
installed to the `topaz` environment, as follows.

```shell script
conda install cudatoolkit=9.0 -c pytorch
```
