# Cryo-EM Particle Picker Evaluation

### Hello! :wave:

This repository (repo) contains installation guides, procedures, and patches for cryo-EM particle pickers, as followed during our experimentation for [TODO: FILL PAPER CITATION].

**:point_right: Please begin by referring to the [wiki](../../wiki).**

To clone the most recent version of this repo, `cd` to a convenient directory and run the following. **Note that for all installation guides, the default assumption is that your current working directory is the root of the repo.**

```shell script
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sebseager/cryoem-picker-eval.git && cd cryoem-picker-eval
```

Please note that the `demo_data/` directory is a little over 330 MB. If this is an issue, please look into performing a [partial clone](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/).
